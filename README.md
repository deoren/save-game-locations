# save-game-locations

This repo is for collecting locations of "save games" for games that I've played a lot
in the past. At some point in the past I put together a basic script to loop over a 
text file containing these entries and create archives of the contents. This allowed 
me to easily backup those files for later use.

If I find myself touching this content often I will probably migrate it to JSON format
for easy programmatic access.
